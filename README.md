# Fully Connected Neural Network for molecular properties prediction given SELFIES encodings 

Current FCNN is refactored to learn any list of SELFIES encodings of molecules and their quantitative properties such as toxicity, solubility, etc. The codebase also supports translation from SMILES to SELFIES if needed. This codebase was built upon the work of Aspuru-Guzik [repo](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group).

As an example, [this](https://uvaauas.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Norman_descriptors_and_predicted_LC50/20089787) dataset with unfiltered SMILES and their corresponding lethal doses provided by the University of Amsterdam of Applied Sciences could be used for training of this model.
