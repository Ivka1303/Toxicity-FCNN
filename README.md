# Bad Bonds Detector

An RNN taught to predict the toxicity of different molecules based on their string, aka SMILES formula representations. I built on the code provided in Aspuru-Guzik [repo](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group).

To see the full unfiltered dataset with the SMILES and their corresponding lethal doses, please, refer to [this](https://uvaauas.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Norman_descriptors_and_predicted_LC50/20089787) table provided by the University of Amsterdam of Applied Sciences as I couldn't upload it here because it's too large.
