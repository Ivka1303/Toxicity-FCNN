# Fully Connected Neural Network for molecular properties prediction given SELFIES encodings 

Current FCNN is refactored to learn any list of SELFIES encodings of molecules and their quantitative properties such as toxicity, solubility, etc. Example filtered datasets can be found in the datasets folder of this directory. The codebase also supports translation from SMILES to SELFIES if needed. This codebase was built upon the work of Aspuru-Guzik [repo](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group). 

Any suggestions and corrections are welcome at ivanna.kreshchenetska@gmail.com
